Here are my data modeling projects.

## Freddie loan data A/B testing project
In this project I compare the difference of loan variables includes credit score and loan quality before and after the financial crisis. Assuming that all situations are consistent, the only change is that the government has strengthened supervision, I analyze what is the impact on loan quality.
